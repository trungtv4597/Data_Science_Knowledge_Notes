# The lifecycle of a data science project

A data science project is organized around the _three phases_ or _12 steps_:
* **Preparation**: gathering information at the beginning.
    1. _Set Goals_
    2. _Explore_
    3. _Wrangle_
    4. _Assess_
    
* **Building**: from planning through execution, using what you learned during the **preparation** and all the tools that statistics and software can provide to build the product.    
    5. _Plan_
    6. _Analyze_
    7. _Engineer_
    8. _Optimize_
    9. _Execute_
    
* **Finishing**: delivering the product, getting feedback, making revisions, supporting the product, and wrapping up the project.
    10. _Deliver_
    11. _Revise_
    12. _Wrap up_
