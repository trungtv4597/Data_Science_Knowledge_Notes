## What is data Science?
Multi-disciplinary field that brings together concepts from computer science, statistics/machine learning, and data analysis to understand and extract insights from data.

Two paradigms of data research:
1. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Given a problem, what kind of data do we need to help solve it?
2. **Data-Driven**: Given some data, what interesting problems can be solved with it?

The heart of data science is to always ask questions. Always be curious about the world. _What can we learn from this data and How to do it?_

## Types of Data
* **Structured**: e.g. tables, spreadsheets, or relational databases.
* **Unstructured**: e.g. blobs of text, images, audio.
* **Numerical** (quantitative): e.g. height, weight.
* **Categorical** (qualitative): e.g. race, sex, hair color.
* **Big Data**: data that contains greater _variety_ arriving in increasing _volumes_ and with ever-higher _velocity_ (3 Vs). Cannot fit in the memory of a single machine.

## Data Sources/ Fomats
* **Sources**: Companies/Proprietary data, API, Goverment, Academic, Web Scraping/ Crawling.
* **Formats** (most common):
1. CSV:
2. XML:
3. SQL:
4. JSON:
5. Protocol buffers:

## Main Types of Problems
Two problems arise repeatedly in data science:
1. **Classifications**: Assigning something to a discrete set of possibilites. e.g. spam or non-spam, blood type, ...
2. **Regression**: Predicting a numerical value. e.g. someones's income, next year GDP, stock price, ...

## Probability Overview
Probability theory provides a framework for reasoning about likelihood of events.
### Terminology
* **Experiment**: procedure that yields one of a possible set of outcomes e.g. repeatedly tossing a die or coin.
* **Sample Space (S)**: set of possible outcomes of a experiment e.g. if tossing a dice, S= (1,2,3,4,5,6)
* **Event (E)**: set of outcomes of an experiment e.g. event that a roll is 5, or the event that sum of 2 rolls is 7.
* **Probability of an Outcome (s) or P(s)**: number that satisfies 2 properties

    1. For each outcomes s, 0 <= P(s) <= 1
    2. \sum
